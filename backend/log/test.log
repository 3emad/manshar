[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/v1/registrations?user%5Bemail%5D=tester%40test.biz&user%5Bname%5D=tester&user%5Bpassword%5D=tester123&user%5Bpassword_confirmation%5D=tester123".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]
